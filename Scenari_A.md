# Scenario A

Hi John,

Thank you so much for reaching us out in regards of bumping up your course.

Congratulation! by the way on being a straight A student at MIT, we do know that is not easy to achieve and with your dedication and hard work you were able to achieve those grades.

Our placement process is designed to ensure that each student is placed in a track that suits their current skills, allowing them to have the most effective learning experience. This process is based primarily on the pre-work scores, which are a key indicator of the appropriate level for each participant.

While we understand your confidence in your abilities, this course will provide you with the foundational skills at a pace of your current proficiency. This ensures that you wonâ€™t be placed in a class that might be too advanced or too basic for your current skill level, allowing you to fully benefit and enjoy from the program.


For references I would attach the course [syllabus](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip102/syllabus).

All the best.
