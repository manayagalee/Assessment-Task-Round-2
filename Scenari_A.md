# Scenario A

Hi John,

Thank you so much for reaching us out in regards of bumping up your course, We are very glad that you are interested with our courses.

However for your request to bump up your course our admission would as well depend on your pre-work assessment.

Here in Codepath we make sure our students do enjoy our courses and we would not want to place our students to a class that would be too basic or too advance for them. We trully commend and we are glad to hear that you're Straight A's at MIT.

For references I would attach the course [syllabus](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip102/syllabus).

Thank you so much for understanding.
