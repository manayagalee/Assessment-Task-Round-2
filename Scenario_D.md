# Scenario D

Hi Dennis,

Thank you for reaching us out.

We have received your email regarding of your withdrawal appeal, we are sorry to hear that you have been transferred to an observer and thank you for showing so much interest in staying in our course. However, here in Codepath it is very important that we are able to have our assignments submitted on the deadline or extension period, We have as well tried to reach you out through e-mail and slack regarding your missing assignment. 

No worries, being on the observer role give you the opportunity to still have  lifetime access towards the course material provided that you will use the github you used to sign up with us this as well gives you the opportunity of learning on your own pace. 

Thank you for understanding.

All the best,


**Lee**
