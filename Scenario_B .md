Hi Jane,

We at Codepath appreciate your efforst and the interest that you do have in our course.

We have reviewed your work and we are amazed with the effort you have placed into it. As much as we would love to accept you to our courses as of the moment our courses are available for students at our partner universities within the United States. With this CodePath is planning to expand to other countries so students like you would be able to join our courses but as of now we only offer our courses to universities with in the United States.

For references I would be attaching the [requirements](https://support.codepath.org/hc/en-us/articles/10451637099035-Eligibility-Requirements) for eligibility of the courses.

Thank you for your understanding.
