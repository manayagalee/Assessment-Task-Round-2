# Scenario B

Hi Jane,

We at Codepath appreciate your efforst and the interest that you do have in our course. We have reviewed your work and we are amazed with the effort you have placed into it. 

We do understand how disappoingting it must be to learn about the eligibility requirements at this stage, However we strice to ensure that all applicants are aware of our eligibility criteria, Which are provided on the front page of our application process. We do understand that these details can sometimes be skipped and we regret the confusion this may have caused.

Currently, due to the sponsorshis program that CodePath is getting since we all know that Codepath is a non-profitable organization, our courses are  restricted to students that are enrolled in our partner universities with in the United States. Which helps us to maintain the quality of our programs, We do understand that we had previous courses at Haiti and Taiwan. We are as well looking into expandiung to toher countries, yet these initiative are not yet in place.

We appreciate your passion towards learning and choosing our programs. Although as of the moment due to our eligiblity criteria we are unable to make exceptions at this time.

For references I would be attaching the [requirements](https://support.codepath.org/hc/en-us/articles/10451637099035-Eligibility-Requirements) for eligibility of the courses.

Once again, thank you for your understanding and for the time and effort you have invested in ythe application process. We wish you all the best in your educational and professional goals.

All the best,
